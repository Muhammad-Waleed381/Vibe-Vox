## 📖 Overview
**VibeVox-Core** is an open-source audio synthesis engine that moves beyond static Text-to-Speech. Unlike standard TTS systems that read an entire document in a monotone "reading voice," VibeVox analyzes the **semantic sentiment** of the text stream and dynamically modulates the **prosody, pitch, and tone** of the voice model in real-time.

It utilizes a producer-consumer architecture to chain a lightweight analysis LLM (Qwen2.5-0.5B) with a high-fidelity diffusion TTS model (Qwen3-TTS), ensuring the voice sounds "Scared" when the text is scary, and "Elated" when the text is happy—without breaking the latency budget.

## 🛠️ The "Why" (Engineering Challenges)
Building this required solving three core ML Engineering problems:
1.  **Prompt Compilation:** Mapping discrete sentiment classification labels (Positive/Negative/Neutral) into rich natural language prompts ("A shaky, whispering voice...") that Qwen3-TTS's 'Voice Design' mode can interpret.
2.  **Identity Persistence:** Ensuring that while the *emotion* changes, the *speaker identity* remains constant across inference steps (preventing "Voice Drift").
3.  **Latency Hiding:** Implementing a threaded buffer system where text analysis happens $N+1$ steps ahead of audio generation to achieve near-instant playback.

## 🏗️ Architecture

1.  **Ingestion:** Text is semantically chunked (sentence/paragraph level).
2.  **The Brain (Analysis):** `Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct` analyzes the chunk for two vectors:
    * *Emotion:* (e.g., "Suspense")
    * *Intensity:* (e.g., "High")
3.  **The Compiler:** A mapping layer converts vectors into a **Style Prompt**.
    * *Input:* `{"Emotion": "Suspense", "Speaker": "Male_Narrator"}`
    * *Output Prompt:* "A deep male voice speaking slowly and quietly, as if revealing a secret."
4.  **The Mouth (Synthesis):** `Qwen3-TTS` generates the audio segment.
5.  **The Stream:** Audio is stitched via `pydub` (cross-faded to remove popping) and streamed to the output device.
